# Node GitHub cards

Since LinkedIn closed the GitHub app, I didn't really know how to share my GitHub information on LinkedIn, till now. I loved 
[Guille Paz's](https://github.com/pazguille/github-card) idea of creating cards with your GitHub information, but it's not an image so not really suitable for LinkedIn. So I combined the GitHub API and Guille's idea of creating cards in an app which generates an image, using node-webshot. The result is a "real-time" image:

![github profile](http://node-github-cards.herokuapp.com/images/profile-basic)

LinkedIn screenshot:

This way you can share your github profile on LinkedIn the same way as [Stackoverflow flairs](stackoverflow.com/users/flair)
